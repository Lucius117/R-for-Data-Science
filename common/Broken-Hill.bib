abstract = {Australia has a long history of metal mining and smelting. Extraction and processing have resulted in elevated levels of toxic metals surrounding mining operations, which have adverse health effects, particularly to children. Resource companies, government agencies and employees often construct ‘myths' to down play potential exposure risks and responsibility arising from operating emissions. Typical statements include: contaminants are naturally occurring, the wind blows emissions away from residential areas, contaminants are not bioavailable, or the problem is a legacy issue and not related to current operations. Evidence from mining and smelting towns shows that such ‘myths' are exactly that. In mining towns, the default and primary defence against contamination is that elevated metals in adjacent urban environments are from the erosion and weathering of the ore bodies over millennia—hence ‘naturally occurring'. Not only is this a difficult argument to unravel from an evidence-based perspective, but also it causes confusion and delays remediation work, hindering efforts to reduce harmful exposures to children. An example of this situation is from Broken Hill, New South Wales, home to one of the world's largest lead–zinc–silver ore body, which has been mined continuously for over 130 years. Environmental metal concentration and lead isotopic data from soil samples collected from across Broken Hill are used to establish the nature and timing of lead contamination. We use multiple lines of evidence to unravel a ‘miner's myth' by evaluating current soil metal concentrations and lead isotopic compositions, geological data, historical environmental assessments and old photographic evidence to assess the impacts from early smelting along with mining to the surface soils in the city.},

Transport of lead and zinc ore concentrates from the Broken Hill mines has occurred for more than 125 years, during which time the majority was moved in uncovered rail wagons. A significant amount of ore was lost to the adjoining environments, resulting in soil immediately adjacent to train lines elevated with concentrations of lead (695 mg kg-1) and zinc (2230 mg kg-1). Concentrations of lead and zinc decreased away from the train line and also with depth shown in soil profiles. Lead isotopic compositions demonstrated the soil lead contained Broken Hill ore in increasing percentages closer to the train line, with up to 97{\%} apportioned to the mined Broken Hill ore body. SEM examination showed ceiling dusts collected from houses along the train line were composed of unweathered galena particles, characteristic of the concentrate transported in the rail wagons. The loss of ore from the uncovered wagons has significantly extended the environmental footprint of contamination from local mining operations over an area extending hundreds of kilometres along each of the three train lines.

abstract = {This study was undertaken to determine whether home remediation effectively reduced indoor lead levels in Broken Hill, a long-established silver-lead-zinc mining town in outback Australia. A before-after study of the effect of home remediation on indoor lead levels was embedded into a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of remediation for reducing elevated blood lead levels in young children. Moist towelettes were used to measure lead loading ($\mu$g/m2) on internal windowsills and internal and entry floors of 98 homes; samples were collected before, immediately after, and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 months after remediation. Data were log10 transformed for the analysis. Remediation reduced average indoor lead levels by approximately 50{\%}, and lead levels remained low for the duration of the follow-up period (10 months). The greatest gains were made in homes with the highest initial lead levels; homes with low preremediation lead levels showed little or no benefit. Before remediation, homes located in areas with high soil lead levels or with "poor" dust proofing had higher lead levels than those in areas with lower soil lead levels or with "medium" or "good" dust proofing; these relative differences remained after remediation. There was no evidence that lead loading was reduced by an increased opportunity to become aware of lead issues. We conclude that remediation is an effective strategy for reducing the lead exposure of children living in homes with high indoor lead levels. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Resolving the source of environmental contamination is a critical first step in planning remediation and intervention strategies to adduce exposure prevention. However, a major challenge in established mining and smelting communities is that the sources of contamination and related potential health risks are often minimised by polluters and government agencies, often using unsupported scientific claims. A significant and long- standing example of this vexed issue is the protracted dispute over contamination sources and causes of childhood blood Pb exposures in Broken Hill (New South Wales), Australia's longest-operating Pb–Ag–Zn mining city. In order to unravel the sources, causes and impacts of contemporary Pb contamination in Broken Hill, this study applied a multiple lines of evidence approach using a combination of geochemical analyses and human health data. The methods applied included analysis of trace element concentrations in soil, dust, tailing dumps and weathered ores, their Pb isotopic and chemical compositions and the morphological characteristics of individual Pb-rich particles. The results demonstrated that Broken Hill contemporary dust Pb deposits were primarily sourced from current mining emissions as opposed to naturally weathered or legacy sources held in soil and dust around the city. Children living closest to the mining operations were found to be at an increased risk of Pb exposure due to higher dust Pb loading (mean 255 $\mu$g/m2/day) and its high bioaccessibility (75{\%} of total Pb). The effects of current mining emissions on the contemporary dust Pb loading were quantitatively estimated. The analysis showed that a 1{\%} increase in distance away from the current mining operations was associated with -0.501{\%} (95{\%} CI: -0.728, -0.275) reduction in dust Pb loading, while a 1{\%} increase in production intensity at the mine increased the expected amount of dust Pb loading by 1.487{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.537, 2.437{\%}). Consistent with the dust Pb decreasing with distance away from current active mining operations, contemporary blood Pb concentrations (2011–2015) also decreased with distance (i.e. 1{\%} increase in distance was associated with a 0.173{\%} reduction in blood Pb concentration). Soil Pb concentrations, which are a proxy for legacy contamination from atmospheric dust depositions across the city also showed a decreasing trend away from the mining operations. Consequently, analysis of the long-term relationship between environmental Pb and blood Pb (1991–2015) revealed that both soil and dust Pb were significantly correlated with blood Pb concentrations, complicating the specific attribution of these individual sources to blood Pb exposure. To quantify the relevant sources of Pb, two ‘natural experiments' were examined to separate the specific role of dust and soil Pb on children's blood Pb exposures: (a) the city's northerly prevailing wind direction; (b) the 2009 dust storm that blanketed Broken Hill soil with desert borne sands, rich in crustal elements Al, Si and Fe. The analyses showed that children living within the prevailing wind direction were at the greatest risk of elevated blood Pb compared to those living in a non-prevailing wind direction, even after adjusting for effects of residential soil Pb contamination. The role of current emissions on driving exposures was further corroborated by the fact that children's blood Pb shifted systematically with mine Pb production volumes irrespective of remedial interventions. The second natural experiment, the 2009 dust storm, showed blood Pb concentrations still decreased with distance even though soil Pb-distance gradient was reduced after the dust storm. Generalised linear regression analysis of contemporary outdoor dust Pb deposits and blood Pb concentrations corroborated dust as being a significant driver of childhood Pb exposures. This thesis research confirms that soil Pb on its own cannot explain blood Pb distributions and that dust Pb depositions are a significant factor in driving contemporary exposures. This finding provides evidence-based support for the mitigation and remediation approaches that are likely to be the most effective in terms of reducing blood Pb exposures in children—these being a clear need to control current mining emissions in Broken Hill as has been identified in Australia's other mining and smelting communities of Mount Isa and Port Pirie. The adverse consequences of not implementing evidence-based and targeted mitigation and remediation strategies on childhood development outcomes were also evaluated in the thesis. Early childhood development indices (i.e. developmental vulnerabilities—Australian Early Development Census data; school test scores—National Assessment Program Literacy and Numeracy) showed that children from the most contaminated areas in Broken Hill had lower educational performance and higher developmental vulnerabilities, even when normalised for socio-economic status. Similarly, poor scores were identified for Australia's other Pb processing locations of Mount Isa (Queensland) and Port Pire (South Australia), indicating the urgent need to implement the highest standards to limit the impact of mining and smelting Pb emissions on adjoining communities. Finally, application of a multiple lines of evidence as used in this thesis research to establish more precisely the source(s) of exposure in mining and smelting communities could be applied to other locations. Such an approach would help to address unequivocally extant disputes over the sources, causes and impacts of environmental Pb contamination in order to better target remediation and prevention strategies.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine the potential hazard posed by indoor lead dust to young children in Broken Hill, a silver-lead-zinc mining town in outback Australia, and the degree to which lead flux is influenced by factors such as geographical location, house construction type and condition. Methods: 116 homes were selected and 93 (80{\%}) studied from 10 localities in Broken Hill during the spring of 1995. Lead flux was measured using 85 mm diameter polystyrene petri dishes. Dishes were placed in four rooms of each house to collect dust over a six-to-eight-week period. Data on the location, condition and construction type of each house were recorded. Multiple linear regression was used to determine predictors of lead flux. Flux data were log transformed for the analysis. Results: Average household lead flux varied nearly seven-fold across districts from a low of 166 (distant from the mines), to a high of 1,104 $\mu$g/m2/30-day period (adjacent to the mines). Houses that were 'adequately sealed' had 2.9 times the lead flux, and 'poorly sealed' houses 4.3 times the flux, of 'very well sealed' houses. Construction material did not significantly affect these flux levels, and no statistically significant interactions were found between house condition and location or house type. Conclusions: Many Broken Hill homes have high levels of lead flux that pose a potential risk to young children. Quantification of this hazard provides useful information for the community that can help focus efforts on actions required to minimise lead dust in the home. Implications: Household dust is a potential source of lead for young children in at-risk communities. Information on lead flux in homes can assist these communities and public health agencies to better understand and deal more effectively with the problem.},

abstract = {To assist in recommendations for the most suitable lead abatement policies in Broken Hill, NSW, Australia, knowledge of the sources and pathways of the lead into humans is critical. High precision lead isotope ratio measurements and lead contents were determined by thermal ionization mass spectrometry on biological samples (blood, urine) and environmental samples from 27 families. Sources of lead have been identified in the blood of children, using lead isotopes, with dominant contributions from the Broken Hill orebody, but with individual cases having a dominant source of lead from gasoline or paint. Scanning electron microscopy identified the most common lead species in soils and dusts to be composed of a complex Pb,Fe,Mn,Ca,Al,Si, O material with rare galena in houses close to the central mining activity. The currently suggested amounts of {\~{}}100 mg/d ingested soil (dirt) and dust for a Broken Hill child can readily account for the elevated lead levels compared with the amounts for children in many other mining communities. -from Authors},

abstract = {Arsenic, cadmium and lead in aerosols, dusts and surface soils from Australia's oldest continuous lead mining town of Broken Hill were compared to standardised national childhood developmental (year 1) and education performance measures (years 3,5,7,9). Contaminants close to mining operations were elevated with maximum lead levels in soil: 8900 mg/kg; dust wipe: 86,061 $\mu$g/m 2 ; dust deposition: 2950 $\mu$g/m 2 /day; aerosols: 0.707 $\mu$g/m 3 . The proportion of children from Broken Hill central, the area with the highest environmental contamination, presented with vulnerabilities in two or more developmental areas at 2.6 times the national average. Compared with other school catchments of Broken Hill, children in years 3 and 5 from the most contaminated school catchment returned consistently the lowest educational scores. By contrast, children living and attending schools associated with lower environmental contamination levels recorded higher school scores and lower developmental vulnerabilities. Similar results were identified in Australia's two other major lead mining and smelting cities of Port Pirie and Mount Isa.},

abstract = {Background: Broken Hill is home to Australia's oldest silver–zinc–lead mine. However, the precise source of childhood blood lead (PbB) exposures has been subject to considerable debate. Lead sources include natural soil Pb enrichment, legacy deposition, contemporary mining emissions, and Pb-based paint. Objective: To test whether contemporary mining emissions independently affect childhood PbB in Broken Hill. Methods: Children's ({\textless}5 years old) PbB measures from 2011 to 2015 (n = 4852), obtained from Broken Hill Child {\&} Family Health Centre, were analyzed using generalised linear regression models, including covariates of household soil Pb, city dust Pb concentrations (PbD), demographic factors and Pb ore production. Two natural experiments involving wind direction and the 2009 dust storm were examined to test whether the PbB-distance gradient from the mining operations was influenced by contemporary emissions. The influence of contemporary emissions was further interrogated by examining the effect of ore production on PbB and PbD. Results: Children living downwind and proximate to the mine had substantially higher PbB outcomes than children similarly distant but upwind. Dust Pb deposition increased significantly with proximity to mining operations as well to Pb production (1991–2013). Average annual PbB correlated with Pb ore production (p {\textless} 0.01) with all subsets of children PbB levels responding with near unit elasticity to Pb ore production (p {\textless} 0.01). Pre- and post-analysis of the dust storm showed the PbB-distance gradient remained statistically unaltered further confirming contemporary emissions as a source of exposure. Conclusions: Contemporary mining emissions influence children's PbB measures independent of other sources and need to be remediated to facilitate reductions in harmful exposure.},
