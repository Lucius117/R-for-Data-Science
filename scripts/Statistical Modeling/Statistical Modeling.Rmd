The intended use of a model should shape the appropriate form of the model and  determines the sorts of data that can properly be used to build the model.

Three main uses for statistical models

1. Description
2. Classification or prediction
3. Anticipating the consequences of interventions

The appropriate form of a model depends on the purpose.

The main points of this book

1. Statistics is about variation. Describing and interpreing variation is a major goal fo statistics.
2. You can create empirical, mathematical descriptions not only of a single trait or varailbe but also of the relationsihops between two or more traits. Empirical means based on measurements, data, observations.
3. Models let you split variation into components: explained versus unexplained
